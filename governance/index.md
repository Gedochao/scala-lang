## Who's behind Scala?

Scala was created by [Prof. Martin Odersky](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/)
at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch).

The Scala language and associated websites are cooperative projects of the
[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch), the Scala 3
team in Martin's research group, LAMP (also at EPFL), the Scala teams at
[Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com),
and the Scala community more broadly, with participation from many companies,
organizations, and individuals.

Scala 2 maintenance is primarily handled by the Lightbend team. They also
participate in Scala 3 development.

VirtusLab focuses on infrastructure and tooling for Scala 3.

The Scala Center focuses on coordinating governance, education (especially
online courses), documentation, open source community outreach, and tooling.
Community participation in all of these efforts is strongly encouraged.
