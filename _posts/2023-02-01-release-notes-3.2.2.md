[Scala 3.2.2](https://github.com/scala/scala3/releases/tag/3.2.2) is now available!

This version not only fixes bugs but also brings two new flags:

- `-Vrepl-max-print-characters` allows you to configure how many characters can be printed in the REPL before truncating the output. The default limit was also raised from 1,000 to 50,000 characters.
- `-Ylightweight-lazy-vals` enables new lazy vals implementation. It can be much more performant, especially in cases of parallel access. However, it can cause problems when used inside of GraalVM native image. We will make the new implementation the default one as soon as we fix those problems.
