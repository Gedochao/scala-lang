title: "JDK 17 will be the next minimum version required by Scala 3"
by: Tomasz Godzik, VirtusLab & Scala Core Team

We recently asked for community input on changing the JDK version used by the
Scala 3 compiler. We now thank everyone for their input and announce the
decision to switch to JDK 17 as the new minimum, starting with Scala 3.8 minor
and the subsequent new LTS which will mostly likely be Scala 3.9.

Our reasoning for dropping 8 was presented in this [previous blog
post](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/next-scala-lts.html).

The discussion on whether to also drop 11 didn't uncover any compelling reason not to leave JDK 11 behind.
11 is now nearly as antiquated as 8, and moving from 11 to 17 is not normally considered a
difficult upgrade for users. 17 offers useful APIs and VM features. In the JVM
world, requiring 17+ is already a mainstream position and is becoming more so
with every passing month. Also, we increase Scala's minimum so rarely, we feel
we should take this chance to aid open-source maintainers by reducing the
testing and maintenance burden across the entire Scala 3 tooling and library
ecosystems as much as we reasonably can.

The open discussion that led to this decision can be found at the
[Scala contributors forum](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/next-scala-3-lts-version-will-increase-minimum-required-jdk-version).

## What about Scala 3.3 LTS?

This change only concerns future minor versions of Scala 3. In particular, the
Scala 3.3 LTS line is unaffected by this change. Scala 3.3.x releases will
continue for at least a year after the new LTS line begins.

## What about Scala 2?

There are no plans to change Scala 2â€™s JDK support.  It will continue
being built using JDK 8, as before.
