title: "Next Scala 3 LTS version"
by: Tomasz Godzik

**TLDR;**

An API used in the `lazy val` implementation will be removed in a future JDK.
Its replacement is only available on JDK 9+. Therefore, the Scala 3 Next minors
in 2025 Q4 and the next LTS will drop JDK 8 support.

## Intro

For the compilerâ€™s second LTS version, the Scala 3 compiler team will be
dropping support for JDK 8 and is considering which later JDK to use.

## Immediate motivation

The recent [JEP 471](https://openjdk.org/jeps/471) stated that the memory-access
methods in sun.misc.Unsafe are scheduled for removal in a future release.
Currently, Scala 3 uses sun.misc.Unsafe in its implementation of lazy values.
This was needed due to compatibility with JDK 8. In order to support JDK 25+, we
will need to drop usage of Unsafe. We are investigating the required changes
under [this issue](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues/9013). It also started
to dawn on the compiler team that we might consider stopping to support JDK 8
altogether in a future release of Scala 3.

## Long term motivation

Switching to a newer version of the JDK would allow both the compiler and the
Scala ecosystem to start using new features and standard library improvements
brought in by JDK 9+. brought in by JDK 9+. This might include a number of JEPs,
which the compiler team will investigate during the coming year. To check the
current status, take a look at the issues marked with the
[JEP label](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acompat%3Ajava%3Ajep).

Some of the features that might be interesting to the Scala community are:

- [JEP 181](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues/22292) will allow classes
  that are logically part of the same code entity, but which are compiled to
  distinct class files, to access each other's private members. This is
  especially useful for nested classes or companions. Currently, the Scala
  compiler has to insert public bridge methods to broaden the accessibility of
  those members.
- [JEP 409](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues/22298) introduces sealed
  classes. It would allow the compiler to better represent Scala's sealed trait
  hierarchies.
- [JEP 441](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues/22450) introduces new
  bytecode shapes for pattern matching in Java. With them, we may be able to
  optimize the code resulting from Scala pattern matches.
- [JEP 471](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues/9013) adds a new API for
  memory access. We will use it to replace the usage of `sun.misc.Unsafe` in
  Scala 3.

Dropping JDK 8 will reduce the maintenance burden on tooling and library
authors. They currently have to take into account a large number of different
versions, both for correctness and performance. Thus, the benefits of this
change will be felt ecosystem-wide.

JDK 8 was first published on 18th March 2014, over 10 years ago. JDKs have
advanced greatly through that period. In order to stay competitive, using those
advancements is a must. A lot of the existing distributions, such as
[Oracle's one](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html),
have already stopped or will soon stop updating JDK 8 with security and other
fixes. Staying on JDK 8 might directly impact issues within your business
applications.

Some larger projects within JVM and Scala ecosystems have already dropped JDK 8
support in favor of JDK 11 or even 17.

Java examples include:

- [Spring 6](https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/16/spring-framework-6-0-goes-ga)
  will require JDK 17
- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/6.6/) requires JDK 11 and the
  next version will require JDK 17
- [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/dependencies.html) requires JDK 11

Scala examples include:

- [Spark 4](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43005#issuecomment-1731344040)
  will require JDK 17
- [Play Framework](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/11078)
  requires JDK 11 and
  [will require JDK 17](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/12179)
  in the next major release
- [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/32127) requires JDK 11
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#java) requires JDK 11
- [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8434) requires JDK 11
- [Li Haoyi's ecosystem](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi) requires JDK 11 across
  the board

It is always possible not to update your libraries and compiler version, which
will avoid having to switch to a newer JDK. However, it is highly discouraged,
as it will make you vulnerable to potential security risks.

## Plan for making the switch

The current plan is to drop support of JDK 8 in one of the future minor releases
of Scala 3 and in the next LTS. The JDK will be either 11 or 17, depending on
the community feedback and our investigations. The current estimate for the next
LTS is Q4 2025.

One major challenge will be to preserve backward compatibility. As we change the
encoding of `lazy val`s, we must still be able to use libraries compiled with
earlier Scala 3 versions.

## How does it affect me?

The current line of LTS under 3.3.x will be supported for at least another year
after the release of the next LTS version. That should give you plenty of time
to migrate. After that, no more security fixes will be available for Scala 3
versions supporting JDK 8. If you are using Scala 3 on JDK 8, do let us know!

If it is not possible for you to switch, be sure to send us your feedback so
that we can figure out a way to help you migrate.

## Discussions and further reading

You can track the current work related to lazy values under
[this issue](https://github.com/scala/scala3/issues/9013). Discussions on the
topic of dropping JDK 8 support will soon be available on the
[Scala contributors forum](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/)
