# Scala 2.12.6

Scala 2.12.6 is now available.

The main highlight is:

  - Macros work again when compiling on Java 9 or 10, fixing 2.12.5 regression ([PR #6446](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6446))

For more details, see the [full release notes](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.12.6) on GitHub.
