We are delighted to announce the availability of Scala 2.13!

The 2.13.0 release improves Scala in the following areas:

* **Collections**: Standard library collections have been overhauled
  for simplicity, performance, and safety. This is the centerpiece
  of the release.
* **Standard library**: `Future` is faster and more robust.
  Elsewhere, useful classes and methods have been added.
* **Language**: Literal types, partial unification, by-name
  implicits, more.
* **Compiler**: 5-10% faster, deterministic output, improved optimizer.
