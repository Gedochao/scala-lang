title: Scala 3.2.1 released!
---

[Scala 3.2.1](https://github.com/scala/scala3/releases/tag/3.2.1) is now available!

This version is a bug-fixing release focusing mainly but not exclusively on solving rare issues with code not compiling after upgrading the language version to 3.2.0. This release also brings two notable enhancements:

- You can use published versions of the compiler to experiment with [capture checking](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/experimental/cc.html). You are no longer required to build the compiler from the sources from the experimental branch. Note that the capture-checking feature is still in an early experimental stage and needs lots of work and time before it becomes stable.
- It includes the first batch of frontend changes to generated Scaladoc. You can see the overall direction of changes and some future improvements by visiting the documentation site for [the standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/3.2.1/).
