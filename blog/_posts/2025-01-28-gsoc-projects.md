---

Are you an open source Scala maintainer? The Scala Center is preparing to participate in [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC), and we're on the lookout for projects to include in this year's program.

## What is GSoC?

GSoC is an online mentorship program that connects beginner contributors with mentors from the community, offering them the chance to contribute to open source software development. Following the success of previous editions, [including 10 successful Scala contributions in 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/scala-center), the Scala Center is excited to apply for GSoC 2025.

## How to apply as a mentor?

We are currently reaching out to potential mentors to assemble a list of project ideas. This is a great opportunity for open source maintainers to get some fresh hands on their Scala projects and involve new contributors at the beginning of their open source Scala journey!

If you maintain an open source Scala project and are interested in mentoring a contributor, we'd love to hear from you! Please reach out to us at [scala-gsoc@epfl.ch](mailto:scala-gsoc@epfl.ch) by February 7th, 2025 to submit your project.

Let's work together to make GSoC 2025 another fruitful opportunity for the Scala ecosystem.
