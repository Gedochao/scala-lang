---

We are very happy to announce that [Scala Days](https://scaladays.org/) will be taking place in Scala's sunny hometown of Lausanne, Switzerland, 19&ndash;21 August 2025.
The conference is organised by the Scala Center at the SwissTech Convention Center, in the heart of campus at EPFL (√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne).

## Co-located events

Workshops and other co-located events will take place the week of the conference, starting on August 18.
Why not seize the opportunity and stay a full week in Lausanne to get the most out of your trip?
And maybe even enjoy some extra time sightseeing and relaxing by Lake Geneva (Lac L√©man), overlooked by the magnificent Alps?

## Spirit of Scala Days 2025

üåê **Business-driven.**
Business networking and exchange of cutting edge technology ideas are the beating heart of Scala Days.
Since 2010, companies have found new business partners, ideas, and various innovative solutions.
It's to this conference that people come for inspiration from experienced Scala shops and startups alike.
It's where the future of Scala business takes shape.

‚ù§Ô∏è **Community-infused.**
Whenever the Scala Center organises an event, it does so in coordination with various other community organisations and contributors, all powered by love for Scala.
Scala Days 2025 will also benefit from this synergy, bringing the community together to learn, share, contribute, and celebrate successes and lessons learned along the way.

ü¶∏ **Family-friendly.**
Just like last time Lausanne hosted Scala Days (back in 2019), daycare will be available at the venue for working parents.
In addition, accompanying persons may join for conference meals and surrounding parties, as well as specially organised tours in the region.
Bring your family along!
